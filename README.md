## Coding Tasks

For each of the tasks included in this project's [Issues Page](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc) you should create branch and a pull request.

Your branch should include tests that verify that your code behaves as expected.

Your pull request description should explain your changes and include steps to verify that your change works.

You should limit yourself to spend a few hours at the most on this exercise. If you run out of time to complete all tasks, consider leaving a comment on the issue page explaining how you'd like to have implemented it.

Things that you should consider include:

* Does it work as described?
* Is it understandable?
* Is it well implemented?
